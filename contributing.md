At this point you're waiting on us. We will endeavour to approve requests or comment within a week.
Please remember this is a hobby and no one is making money on this. :-) We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives to your suggestions or approve them outright.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Drop in on IRC and talk about your changes.
* Fix an open issue.
* Write a good commit message][commit].
* Explain how you tested the changes, any known limitations on Windows version or Linux.
