Why are other script interpreters so complex? Why is it so difficult to integrate with them and use the API? Why not try MY-BASIC today! Script have never been so simple and enjoyable.

## Introduction

MY-BASIC is a lightweight cross-platform easy extendable BASIC interpreter written in pure C with less than twenty thousand lines of source code. MY-BASIC is a dynamic typed programming language. It supports structured grammar, and implements a style of OOP called [prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming) paradigm, furthermore it offers a functional programming ability with [lambda abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function). It is aimed to be either an embeddable scripting language or a standalone interpreter. The core is very lightweight; all in a C source file and an associated header file; simpleness of source file layout and tightness dependency make it extraordinarily tough. Anyone even C programming newbies could learn how to use it and add new scripting interfaces in five minutes. It's able to easily combine MY-BASIC with an existing project in C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Swift, C# and many other languages. Script driven can make your projects more powerful, elegant and neat. It's also able to learn how to build an interpreter from scratch with MY-BASIC, or build your own interpreter easily based on it.

"MY-" in the name could be understood literally as "My" or "Make Your", depends on you.

## Compatibility

It fits well on a large scale of Workstation, PC, Tablet, Pad, Mobile Phone, PDA, Video Game Console, Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison, Arduino and even MCU; totally portable to Windows, macOS, Unix, Linux, iOS, Android, RTOS, etc.

## Main features

MY-BASIC is a dynamic typed programming language with BASIC syntax and has a very dynamic nature; it makes it flexible and easy to use. MY-BASIC offers a wide range of features including:

* It is totally **free** to use MY-BASIC for commercial or noncommercial purpose under the MIT license
* Written in clean **ANSI C**, source code is portable to a dozen of platforms
* **Lightweight** (within memory usage less than 128KB), fast, and cuttable
* With both retro and modern BASIC syntax
* Case-insensitive tokenization, and many other indelible BASIC feelings
* [Unicode support](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic/wiki/Support-for-Unicode)
* **[Prototype-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming)** (OOP) paradigm, with reflection support
* **[Lambda abstraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function)** enhanced functional programming
* **Dynamic typed** integer, real, string, boolean, usertype, etc. with array support
* Standard numeric functions, and standard string functions
* Referenced usertype support
* Collection implementation and manipulation functions for **`LIST`** and **`DICT`**
* Automatic releasing of referenced objects (list, dictionary, referenced usertype, prototype, lambda, etc.) benefited from **Reference Counting** and **Garbage Collection**
* Multiple source file support by `IMPORT` statement
* Structured user customizable **sub routine** definition by **`DEF/ENDDEF`** support, including tail recursion optimization
* Structured `IF/THEN/ELSEIF/ELSE/ENDIF` support
* Structured `FOR/TO/STEP/NEXT`, `FOR/IN/NEXT`, `WHILE/WEND`, `DO/UNTIL` support
* Reserved retro `GOTO`, `GOSUB/RETURN` support
* Debug APIs
* Customizable memory pool
* High expansibility, easy to use APIs, easy to write customized scripting interfaces
* Powerful interactive ability to manipulate script facilities at native side; or to use native functionalities in script, and vice versa
* More features under development

You may wondering if it's possible to introduce another feature to MY-BASIC, well, you may would like to take a look at [this page](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic/wiki/Is-it-possible-to-introduce-another-feature%3F).

## Script at a glance

Come along with a traditional "Hello World" script in MY-BASIC:

~~~~~~~~~~bas
input "What is your name: ", n$

def foo(a, b)
	return a + " " + b + " by " + n$ + "."
enddef

print foo("Hello", "world");
~~~~~~~~~~

Read the [MY-BASIC Quick Reference](MY-BASIC%20Quick%20Reference.pdf) (especially the "**Programming with BASIC**" section) to get more details about how to program in MY-BASIC.

## [Interpreter workflow diagram](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic/wiki/Interpreter-workflow-diagram)

It's necessary to know some principle of MY-BASIC before doing deep customization; nothing's better than a workflow diagram to get a first impression.

More detail are issued in the [Wiki](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic/wiki) pages.

## Installation

### Use standalone interpreter binary

This repository contains precompiled binaries for [Windows](output/my_basic.exe) and [macOS](output/my_basic_mac), it's efficient to download one of them and have a first impressive playground. Or you could make a build as follow:

* Open the Visual Studio solution `my_basic.sln` on Windows to build an executable
* Open the Xcode solution `my_basic_mac.xcodeproj` on macOS to build an macOS executable
* If you were using a *nix OS, then use the `makefile` with a "make" toolchain to build an interpreter binary according to your specific platform

To compile an interpreter binary for your own platform manually, please follow the steps:

1. Retrieve at least `core` and `shell` folders for a minimum build
2. Setup your compile toolchain configuration
3. Compile `core/my_basic.c` and `shell/main.c`, they both require `core/my_basic.h`; then link up your own executable

The standalone interpreter supports three running modes:

* Execute the binary without arguments to enter MY-BASIC's interactive mode
* Pass a file path to the binary to load and run that script file directly
* Pass an argument `-e` followed by an expression to evaluate it and print the result, eg. `-e "2 * (3 + 4)"`

Type "HELP" and hint Enter under interactive mode to view full detail usage of the interpreter.

### Combine with exist projects

MY-BASIC is cleanly written in a single C source file and an associated header file. Just copy `my_basic.c` and `my_basic.h` to your project folder and add them to a build configuration.

You can definitely [link with MY-BASIC as a lib](https://github.com/paladin-t/my_basic/wiki/Link-with-MY_BASIC) as well.

For more details about using MY-BASIC when it has be integrated with a project, please see [MY-BASIC Quick Reference](MY-BASIC%20Quick%20Reference.pdf) or read the following Wiki pages.
