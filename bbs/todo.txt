                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2015 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

* to try strip down all message base code in wwiv to have no external
  dependencies so it can get moved into sdk.`
* make all wwiv datafile data into vector and not malloc'ed 
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* change record 0 of .sub files to be a message header. Right now only owneruser
  is used and the rest is loaded/saved as-is by the bbs code.
* Merge fix into wwivutil
* remove support for registration numbers in the wwivnet data binary files.
* delete num_events
* make ssm take a string (use StringPrintf as needed)
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* mmkey is a mess. only odc seems to be used right.
* fix display issue on messages (rushnet 2, 4, 6)

* Move bbs logic out of WLocalIO and into WSession (probably)
* remove extra include statements from user.cpp
* Finish wrappering WSession
* add IncrementXXXXX methods to User where it makes sense.
* Change parameters to use strings so Runnable can use a vector of strings vs, argc, argv
* investigate making WTextFile always trim whitespace
* Improve StringTrim(string)'s whitespace code and just have 1 copy of the whitespace string.
