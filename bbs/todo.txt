                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2016 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================


Ini Files and Configuration
===========================
* make all places where we open wwiv.ini respect node settings in the bbs.
* Add net.ini support into network{1,2,3}

General Cleanup
===============
* move File to namespace wwiv::core
* get rid of more char[] variables from vars.h, move to wsession as strings.
* get rid of syscfg.{datadir} in bbs code, use config() strings.
* cleanup wfc since we aren't waiting for a call
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* remove extra include statements from user.cpp
* Finish wrappering WSession
* add IncrementXXXXX methods to User where it makes sense.
* Change parameters to use strings so Runnable can use a vector of strings vs, argc, argv
* investigate making WTextFile always trim whitespace
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO

General Improvements
====================
* Create wwivutil print command to print files in ANSI with heart and pipe codes
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system. It's awful.

Net52
=====
* update routing information in network1.
* Create new JSON version of networks.dat that includes FTN data.
* Add wwivutil config {set,get}-version <version>

Message Areas
=============
* to try strip down all message base code in wwiv to have no external
  dependencies so it can get moved into sdk.
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* internet email assumes "FILEnet" as a network, this needs to be fixes.
  (search for getnetnum("FILEnet"))
* Make read_type2_message return a structure of the data from a type-2 message. 
  Also add a display_default_header or something to display what read_type2_message
  used to display by default.
* AddMessage should delete messages to keep total number of posts at the right number.
