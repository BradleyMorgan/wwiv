                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2017, WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

FTN
===
* improve addressing for outbound netmail
* add option to save packets
* ability to put more than 1 message per packet.
* zone:region/node is acceptible (not just zone:net/node)

Ini Files and Configuration
===========================
* Add net.ini support into network{1,2,3}

Infrastructure Cleanup
======================
* get rid of more char[] variables from vars.h, move to wsession as strings.
* cleanup wfc since we aren't waiting for a call
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* Maybe make the hangup variable a static in the Application class.
* Try to remove a()->current_net(), pass in the net as much as possible.

Networking Cleanup
==================
* Figure out why new networking stack doesn't work for mark.

core::File Improvements
=======================
* move File to namespace wwiv::core
* start migrating core::File towards fs::filesystem and fs::path naming.
* Create SemaphoreFile class, initially have it replace what we do
  in wwivd, later on also add support for creating semaphores for network
  and other places in wwiv.
* Pass sdk::Config into WWIVEmail vs. root_directory

Feature Improvements
====================
* Create wwivutil print command to print files in ANSI with 
  heart and pipe codes
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate 
  SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system. It's awful.
* Create templatized version of StringToInt(string) that takes the return type.
  i.e. to_number<uint16_t>(const 	string&)

Linux Work
==========
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO
* stop using localIO()->WhereX to determine remote position

Net52
=====

Message Areas
=============
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* Make the emailmessage extend the message so most things are common
  between them.

Open Questions
==============

Closed Questions
==============

1) Guest user account. Is it useful?   - Yes, it just needs to be improved
   and documented.
