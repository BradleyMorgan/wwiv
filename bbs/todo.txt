                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2017, WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

FTN
===
* improve addressing for outbound netmail
* add option to save packets
* ability to put more than 1 message per packet.
* zone:region/node is acceptible (not just zone:net/node)

Ini Files and Configuration
===========================
* Add net.ini support into network{1,2,3}

General Cleanup
===============
* move File to namespace wwiv::core
* get rid of more char[] variables from vars.h, move to wsession 
  as strings.
* cleanup wfc since we aren't waiting for a call
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO
* use daten_t everywhere we have a daten date.
* Maybe make the hangup variable a static in the Application class.
* stop using localIO()->WhereX to determine remote position
* Try to remove a()->current_net(), pass in the net as much as possible.
* don't include wwiv_windows.h from any header file.
* start migrating core::File towards fs::filesystem and fs::path naming.

General Improvements
====================
* Create wwivutil print command to print files in ANSI with 
  heart and pipe codes
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate 
  SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system. It's awful.
* use std::chrono::duration<double> vs. milliseconds in core/ for timing.

Net52
=====
* update routing information in network1.

Message Areas
=============
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* Make the emailmessage extend the message so most things are common
  between them.

Open Questions
==============

Closed Questions
==============

1) Guest user account. Is it useful?   - Yes, it just needs to be improved
   and documented.


 WWIV ACS System
 ===============
 We'll use something like:
 "SL=100 & AR=A" 
 "SL>=100|AR=A" 
 "SL>=50 | R != M"
 "(SL >= 50 & DSL >= 50) | AR=A"

Non-TG Style Attributes
=======================
SL
DSL
RESTRICT
AR
DAR
AGE
USER
 
 Operators

 % false

 != not equals
 < less than
 <= less than or equals
 > greater than
