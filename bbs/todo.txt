                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2017, WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

FTN
===
* improve addressing for outbound netmail
* add option to save packets
* ability to put more than 1 message per packet.
* zone:region/node is acceptible (not just zone:net/node)

Ini Files and Configuration
===========================
* Add net.ini support into network{1,2,3}

General Cleanup
===============
* move logic of offset variables into init
* move File to namespace wwiv::core
* get rid of more char[] variables from vars.h, move to wsession as strings.
* get rid of syscfg.{datadir} in bbs code, use config() strings.
* cleanup wfc since we aren't waiting for a call
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* remove extra include statements from user.cpp
* Finish wrappering Application
* add IncrementXXXXX methods to User where it makes sense.
* Change parameters to use strings so Runnable can use a vector of strings vs, argc, argv
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO
* use daten_t everywhere we have a daten date.
* Maybe make the hangup variable a static in the Application class.
* redo ctim and ctim2
* stop using localIO()->WhereX to determine remote position
* Try to remove a()->current_net(), pass in the net as much as possible.

General Improvements
====================
* Create wwivutil print command to print files in ANSI with heart and pipe codes
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system. It's awful.
* move macro interpreting code outside of bputch

Net52
=====
* update routing information in network1.

Message Areas
=============
* to try strip down all message base code in wwiv to have no external
  dependencies so it can get moved into sdk.
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* AddMessage should delete messages to keep total number of posts at the right number.
* Make the emailmessage extend the message so most things are common between them.
* Load subs.json too, and use it as source of truth if it exists.
