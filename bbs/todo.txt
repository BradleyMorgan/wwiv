                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2016 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

* to try strip down all message base code in wwiv to have no external
  dependencies so it can get moved into sdk.
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* change record 0 of .sub files to be a message header. Right now only owneruser
  is used and the rest is loaded/saved as-is by the bbs code.
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)
* mmkey is a mess.  mostly just mmkey_odc is used. confutil.cpp sets the others.
* cleanup session()->tagging and session()->titled

* remove extra include statements from user.cpp
* Finish wrappering WSession
* add IncrementXXXXX methods to User where it makes sense.
* Change parameters to use strings so Runnable can use a vector of strings vs, argc, argv
* investigate making WTextFile always trim whitespace
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system.
* internet email assumes "FILEnet" as a network, this needs to be fixes. (search for getnetnum("FILEnet"))
