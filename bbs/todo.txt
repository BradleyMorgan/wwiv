                             WWIV BBS TODO List
                 Copyright 2002-2016 WWIV Software Services
==============================================================================

* Move FilePath to file (from inifile)
* move File to namespace wwiv::core
* Add support for more than 2 levels in IniFile (like net-0-561 then net-0, then net)
  this way you can have 3 or more levels of customization
* Add hierarchial settings to networkb.ini
* make all places where we open wwiv.ini respect node settings in the bbs.
* rename networkb.ini to net.ini (merge with wins/bbs net.ini)
* get rid of more char[] variables from vars.h, move to wsession as strings.
* get rid of syscfg.{datadir} in bbs code, use config() strings.
* update routing information in network1.
* cleanup wfc since we aren't waiting for a call
* to try strip down all message base code in wwiv to have no external
  dependencies so it can get moved into sdk.
* detangle global net_email_name (maybe it needs to be added to EmailData?)
* change record 0 of .sub files to be a message header. Right now only owneruser
  is used and the rest is loaded/saved as-is by the bbs code.
* add tests for usermanager and user (in SDK)

* remove extra include statements from user.cpp
* Finish wrappering WSession
* add IncrementXXXXX methods to User where it makes sense.
* Change parameters to use strings so Runnable can use a vector of strings vs, argc, argv
* investigate making WTextFile always trim whitespace
* TopScreen doesn't work with CursesIO
* make a common ACS system (like TG, vs. having separate SL DSL AR fields everywhere for menus)
* cleanup menu system.
* internet email assumes "FILEnet" as a network, this needs to be fixes. (search for getnetnum("FILEnet"))
